This dashboard presents a strategic analysis of supplier performance across retail and warehouse channels, designed to support sourcing decisions, risk monitoring, and operational efficiency. It combines key metrics like total sales, supplier efficiency score, and sales volatility to segment suppliers into meaningful categories — from stable and efficient partners to high-risk, underperforming vendors. Through visuals like treemaps, stacked column charts, scatter plots, and KPI cards, the dashboard highlights channel dependency, performance volatility, and throughput efficiency. Each visual is interactive and filterable by item type, month, and region, allowing users to drill down into supplier behavior and identify actionable insights. This analysis is especially valuable for procurement teams and compliance stakeholders seeking to optimize supplier relationships and align sourcing strategies with business goals.
